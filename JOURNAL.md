# Conscious Code â€“ Build Journal

Welcome to the public journal for the **LangChain v0.3+ Crash Course** â€” a 12-part YouTube series designed to help developers build real agentic apps using the latest LangChain tools.

Iâ€™m documenting everything here: what I publish, what I learn, where I promote, and how it evolves.

**Core Focus:**

  - `initialize_agent()` removal
  - Pydantic v2 migration

**Reflection:**
> Took a lot of effort to get everything out for Ep 1. I'm still learning LangChain, editing video, writing code, and building my presence. No gear, no budget â€” just clarity and persistence. Now that the foundation is in place, Iâ€™ll shift more energy to recording Ep 2.
