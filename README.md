# ðŸŽ¥ LangChain v0.3+ Crash Course: Build Real Agents, Deploy Production-Ready Apps

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ This repo contains the code and project files from a YouTube playlist Iâ€™m making as I learn LangChain v0.3+ myself.

The goal? To understand how the newer LangChain ecosystem works â€” and share what Iâ€™m learning through practical, step-by-step episodes. Itâ€™s aimed at developers who want to go beyond just playing with notebooks and start building real apps and agents using modern tools.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s This Playlist About?

LangChain has changed a lot recently, and many older tutorials are outdated or donâ€™t reflect how things work now. This playlist is an attempt to:

- Learn the **new LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** and modular design
- Build working projects using tools like **Poetry**, **LangGraph**, **LangServe**, and more
- Explore things like deployment, caching, CI/CD, and RAG â€” not just toy examples

Iâ€™m not an expert â€” Iâ€™m learning and figuring things out as I go. If youâ€™re also trying to understand how to use LangChain properly in real dev setups, you might find this useful.
